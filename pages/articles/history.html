                        <p class="paragraph-large">An Ancient Breed</p>
                        <p>Tornjaks hail from the rugged and mountainous regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
                            Given the time period and location, it is speculated that the breed may have existed since
                            Roman times. However, the first written documents describing the characteristics of these
                            mountain dogs are from 1067, which is still incredibly old. Within the Catholic Church
                            archives, further descriptions were found from 1374 and 1752. It is rare to have such old,
                            thorough documentation about a breed.</p><br>
                        <p>Tornjaks are aptly named for their job as livestock guardians. The word “tor” refers to a
                            fenced enclosure for sheep. Nomadic shepherds were once commonplace amongst the land’s
                            mountainous backdrop. These dogs walked side by side with their shepherds, watching
                            vigilantly to protect both the flock and the shepherd from any potential harm.</p><br>
                        <p class="paragraph-large">Facing Extinction</p>
                        <p>As time went on and sheep farming began to decline, the tornjak population declined along
                            with it. The breed became nearly extinct until a group of cynologists decided to resurrect
                            it in 1970’s.
                            The cynologists used descriptions from the ancient manuscripts to select dogs for
                            reproduction. They searched remote mountain farms looking for dogs that had not been in
                            contact with other breeds for generations. The goal was to keep the breed as close to the
                            original flock guardians as possible.</p><br>
                        <p>This was a difficult task given the varied locations of the last remaining dogs and the
                            breeds' minimal numbers. It was also very important that the dogs were healthy and genetic
                            diseases were not propagated. The cynologists worked hard to repopulate the breed and
                            establish breeding standards. By the 1980’s, the tornjak was a nationally recognized breed.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>On February 6th, 2006, after years of dedicated breeding, Croatia and Bosnian Cynology
                            Associations placed a joint application to FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) for
                            international recognition of the breed. The application was accepted and the long road to
                            full breed recognition began. Over the years, the number of dedicated breeders rose, as did
                            the population of tornjaks.</p><br>
                        <p class="paragraph-large">Recent Outlook</p>
                        <p>On November 7th, 2017, the tornjak was granted full FCI breed recognition. Since then, the
                            tornjak population has continued to grow and the number of breed enthusiasts has increased.
                            Word of this amazing breed has spread across the ocean and now tornjaks are popping up all
                            across North America. It is one of the goals of this club to earn full recognition by the
                            American and Canadian Kennel clubs.</p><br>
                        <p class="paragraph-large">Our Responsibility</p>
                        <p>As we begin to open our homes to this noble breed, it’s important that we honor the efforts
                            put forth by all those who helped to revive them.These remarkable dogs carry the legacy of
                            their ancestors, their strength and their devotion to their duties. By participating in
                            ethical breeding and educating future owners, North America can ensure the continuation of
                            an ancient breed deeply rooted in tradition and history.</p>
