                            <p>This story is one of many in our "Living with Guardians" series. The series asks Tornjak
                                owners to share their experience with the breed. For those who have never met a Tornjak,
                                hopefully these stories can provide further insight on this ancient breed.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Please introduce yourself and your dog(s).</p>
                        <p>My name is Samantha Relaford. Our majestic boy is Dali and sweet girl is Betti.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">How long have you had Tornjaks?</p>
                        <p>We have loved Tornjaks in our family for 2yrs.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">How did you first hear about the breed?</p>
                        <p>Our family was researching different livestock guardian breeds. We knew starting out that we
                            didn't have a desire for the American popular Great Pyrenese, so set out to study other
                            breeds. There were several right off the start, but many posed the concern of their
                            reactions to children or to strangers. When we read about Tornjaks, we were instantly drawn
                            to them. Everything described, sounded exactly like what we had hoped for our family, our
                            farm, and for those you step foot on our property.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Are your Tornjaks working as livestock guardians or are they pets? If
                            working, please tell us about your guardian needs - What type of livestock? What types of
                            predators?</p>
                        <p>Our Tornjaks do both. We believe that what makes them so spectacular is their loyalty to
                            their masters, their shepherd. Its teamwork, not simply all on them. Our male learned what
                            matter most to us, and due to his drive to please and extend care over what belongs to us,
                            he guards our sheep, the chickens, hogs, and of course, our children. Our female came from
                            being shown in the ring, and while that definitely suits her personality, she also adjusted
                            to understanding what mattered to us and what she needed to protect. The Tornjaks
                            intelligence, ease to train, and desire to make you proud, truly makes this breed one of a
                            kind and an honor to work alongside.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Had you met a Tornjak before you got one?</p>
                        <p>No</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Where did yours come from - North America? Europe?</p>
                        <p>Bosnia and Croatia</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What sort of research did you do on the breed before deciding it was
                            right for you?</p>
                        <p>Many searches were done online to understand the temperment, the care, the weather needs. We
                            read personal opinions and guides about Tornjaks, but also researched training on LGD breeds
                            in general.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large"> What about the breed was as you expected? (Temperament, energy,
                            grooming, etc)</p>
                        <p>Temperment, loyalty, friendliness, smile (if you know, you know), intelligence, and size.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What about the breed was different than you expected? (Temperament,
                            energy, grooming, etc)</p>
                        <p>We expected them to be less barky than the Great Pyrense is known for. While they may be
                            slightly under the GP, they still do their warning barks at night to preditors and unless
                            joined and told all is well, they'll definitely continue longer than implied.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What lifestyle do you feel would NOT be a good fit for a Tornjak?</p>
                        <p>Apartment life, small yard with no option for run or exercise. I would also always encourage
                            verifying with breeder that dog you are getting fits the dynamic of your current home. If
                            you have another dog, verify the one coming is not alpha minded. Tornjaks take their place
                            in the pack very seriously. Ask the breeder what each individual pup shows character trait
                            to. A good leader or a better follower. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Please feel free to share any other experiences you believe would be
                            relevant to a new owner.</p>
                        <p class="last">These dogs deserve an abundance of respect. The Livestock Guardian dogs within
                            the US have not really allowed for the acceptance of this breeds true majesty. They aren't
                            just another "dog". They are truly something special and will grab hold of your heart once
                            you truly get to know them and love them. Allow the breed to become your partner, your best
                            friend, your companion and once that bond is formed, you'll see every bit of the genetics
                            that make up the Livestock Guardian in them, come alive. While training does matter, it
                            cannot ever replace loyalty these dogs have to YOU.</p>
