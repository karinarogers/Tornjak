                            <p>This story is one of many in our "Living with Guardians" series. The series asks Tornjak
                                owners to share their experience with the breed. For those who have never met a Tornjak,
                                hopefully these stories can provide further insight on this ancient breed.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Please introduce yourself and your dog(s).</p>
                        <p>I am Karina and my husband is Max. We have 2 Tornjaks - Scylla and Dagon. Scylla is almost 2
                            and Dagon is almost 1. They are half siblings.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">How long have you had Tornjaks?</p>
                        <p>almost 2 years</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">How did you first hear about the breed?</p>
                        <p>Google - I worked in veterinary medicine and had seen a lot of breeds. I went on a deep dive
                            internet search to find my perfect match dog breed. I knew I wanted a livestock guardian
                            type temperament and eventually stumbled across Tornjaks.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Are your Tornjaks working as livestock guardians or are they pets? If
                            working, please tell us about your guardian needs - What type of livestock? What types of
                            predators?</p>
                        <p>Pets</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Had you met a Tornjak before you got one?</p>
                        <p>No</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Where did yours come from - North America? Europe?</p>
                        <p>Both were imported from Croatia at 12 weeks old.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What sort of research did you do on the breed before deciding it was
                            right for you?</p>
                        <p>A ton of outreach and networking. The Tornjak FB groups were a huge help. At the time, when I
                            first discovered the breed, I wasn't ready to get another dog. So over the course of a few
                            years I spoke with a many owners and breeders trying to make sure Tornjaks would be a good
                            fit.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large"> What about the breed was as you expected? (Temperament, energy,
                            grooming, etc)</p>
                        <p>Their protective nature and how amazing they are with family. We expected barking and
                            uncertainty around strangers, which stands true.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What about the breed was different than you expected? (Temperament,
                            energy, grooming, etc)</p>
                        <p>Temperament - We spent a LOT of time socializing and training them both. As a result, one is
                            fine around people/dogs but despite our efforts, the other is not acceptable in public. She
                            is reactive towards new people and other dogs. She has had thousands of dollars in training
                            and although she has improved greatly, she is not trustworthy around new people at this
                            time. I knew the breed was wary of strangers but it has surprised me just *how persistent*
                            that trait has been. We love her so much and she's wonderful for our family/lifestyle, but
                            she does take a lot of time, effort and patience. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">What lifestyle do you feel would NOT be a good fit for a Tornjak?</p>
                        <p>First time dog owners or people that like to run/hike long distances (since the joints of
                            large breed dogs are not build for this).</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-large">Please feel free to share any other experiences you believe would be
                            relevant to a new owner.</p>
                        <p class="last">It's important to remember these dogs were bred for a job. They are incredibly
                            strong, powerful and independent. If your lifestyle involves taking your dog everywhere and
                            being social, they may never *enjoy* that, no matter the amount of socializing and training.
